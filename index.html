          Marvin Heiferman explains that millions of photographic images are seen throughout the world and the number rises every day..”

        "It’s about reacting to what you see, hopefully without preconception. You can find pictures anywhere. It’s simply a matter of noticing things and organizing them. You just have to care about what’s around you and have a concern
        with humanity and the human comedy.”

          Photography is an amazing way to document every moment of our lives so we will have that memory forever. You can look back on the photograph and remember what was special during the time frame it was taken. Zimmerman states even
          when a loved one is gone from this earth the pictures you captured of them is the
          <span>
            “proof of their existence” (Zimmerman).With photography you can document each stage in your life journey and the life journey of those important to you. Not only is photography a way to document events in your life, but also
            document the events of the world that turn into history. These photographs are important so we don’t forget what took place and for the future generation to have proof</span

          . To point out just how powerful photography is on documenting things Heiferman quotes Henry Luce, from Life magazine in the 1930s We as human beings are expected to overlook some details of something. None of us can possibly take
          in every little part of a fast moving sunset (Seger).

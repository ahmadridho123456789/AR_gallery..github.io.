        The history of photography began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles: camera obscura image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. There are no
        artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th century. Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry,
        but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce
        detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.

        The commercial introduction of computer-based electronic digital cameras in the 1990s soon revolutionized photography. During the first decade of the 21st century, traditional film-based photochemical methods were increasingly
        marginalized as the practical advantages of the new technology became widely appreciated and the image quality of moderately priced digital cameras was continually improved.
